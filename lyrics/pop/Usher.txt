There's always that one person that will always have your heart
You never see it coming 'cause you're blinded from the start
Know that you're that one for me, it's clear for everyone to see
Oh baby, ooh (yeah, uh, uh, uh) (you gotta rockaway to this one, c'mon)
You will always be my boo
See, I don't know 'bout y'all, but I know about us and, uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know 'bout y'all, but I know about us and, uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
Do you remember, girl?
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
'Cause I remember, girl
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
Girl, I was there when you were my baby
